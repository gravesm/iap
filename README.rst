MIT IAP Courses
===============

This project contains materials for GIS classes I've taught during MIT's Independent Activities Period. You will probably want to look at the GitHub pages:

- `OpenLayers 2 <http://gravesm.github.io/iap/openlayers/>`_
- `TileMill <http://gravesm.github.io/iap/tilemill/>`_
